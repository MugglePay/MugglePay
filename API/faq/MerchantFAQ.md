## Why I can't get the callback request after a payment finished?

If you can't get the callback request after a payment finished, you should check if you correctly pass the `callback_url` params when you send a create order request. Additionally, ensure that the URL starts with **`https`** instead of **`http`**. You also can check the url at [Merchants Order History Page](https://merchants.mugglepay.com/transactions/orders) by click Triger **Payment Callback** button and make sure that the callback response returns a **200 OK** status with `{ status: 200 }` in the body content. Otherwise, the request will be identified as failed, and the system will retry several times. For more details, refer to the [MugglePay documentation](https://docs.mugglepay.com/order/paymentcallback).
