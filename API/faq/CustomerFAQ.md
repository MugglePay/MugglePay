## Order not confirmed or expired or waiting for blockchain

If you have paid with cryptocurrencies (e.g. USDT/ USDC), you can see the txHash or txID and blockchain explorer URL from your platforms. First, check if the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. If it's confirmed, please check the amount is correct and the order is paid within the time window.

Blockchain usually takes some time to confirm based on differet blockchain networks. If your order cannot confirm after 60 minutes, or If the order is expired or you pay a different amount.

## Order not confirmed - Top Reason 1 (Price not match, price volatility issues)

When you pay from your crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Huobi, OKEx), they usually charge a withdrawal fee.

For example, the withdraw fee charged by the exchange is 1 USDT for USDT-Tron and 16 USDT for USDT-Ethereum. The withdrawal fee should be covered by yourself.

For example, if your order is 128.8 USDT and you want to pay USDT-TRC20 from Binance. Currently Binance USDT-TRC20 withdrawal fee is 1 USDT. MugglePay need to receive exactly 128.8, and you should withdraw 129.8 USDT from Binance to cover the withdrawal fee.

If you do not pay the withdrawal fee, and merchant will receive less amount. The order will be marked as expired after 60 minutes. Please contact our support email as soon as possible.

The solution might be paying the missing fee (e.g. 1 USD as the example), or refund the rest of the money (you might need to cover the cost).

## Order not confirmed - Top Reason 2 (Credit Card)

Credit card processing sometimes take a longer time, especially crypto related (due to the credit card risk engine).

For example, if your order is 99 USD and you paid 100 USD from your credit card. The credit card company will charge the processing fee.

If you have not received a confirmation like the screenshots above, the money might be on hold by your bank. Please wait for the confirmation, and let us know if you have the payment receipt like above.

## Order not confirmed - Top Reason 3 (Expired, payment timeout)

By default the payment time window is 10 minutes to 1 hour based on the merchant order configations. However, blockchain payments sometimes take a longer time, even hours.&#x20;

If you pay with stablecoins like USDC, USDT on Tron, Ethereum, Arbitrum, we will mark the order as paid automatically within 24 hours. Even though are orders are expired.&#x20;

If you pay the invoice for more than 24 hours, it will show as expired after the payment window.

* txHash and blockchain exploerer url - this will show the exact amount and time you have paid (also copy text).
