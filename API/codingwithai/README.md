# MugglePay AI Integration

AI can be a powerful tool for developers. We've set up MugglePay integration guides to seamlessly work with your AI assisted coding workflow. Here are the different methods you can use to integrate MugglePay into your existing applications using AI tools:

## Supported AI Tools

### Cursor, Windsurf, etc.
- **Direct Integration** - Use our code examples and prompts to integrate MugglePay into your existing app
- **Cursor MCP** - We support providing search on our docs via MCP, allowing Cursor to directly search our docs rather than you providing them as context

### V0, Lovable, etc.
- **One-shot Implementation** - You can one-shot an example implementation using a direct prompt
- **Direct Prompts** - Simply start your prompt with what kind of integration you want to build, and then based on your tech stack, copy one of the snippets below and paste it in as part of your initial prompt

## Quick Start

Choose your AI tool and follow the specific integration guide to add MugglePay to your existing app:
- **[Cursor Integration](cursor.md)** - For Cursor, Windsurf, and similar AI coding assistants
- **[Lovable Integration](lovable.md)** - For V0, Lovable, and other AI development platforms
